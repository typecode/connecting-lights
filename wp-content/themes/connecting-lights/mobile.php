						<p><strong>Connecting Light</strong> is a digital art installation along Hadrianâ€™s Wall World Heritage Site. The installation consists of hundreds of large-scale, light-filled balloons transmitting colors from one-to-another, creating a communication network spanning over seventy miles.</p>
						
						<div class="more">
							<p>Audience members are invited to participate by sending personalized messages along the light-lined wall at a number of viewing locations or, this Web site and companion mobile app.</p>
