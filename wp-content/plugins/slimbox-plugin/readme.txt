== Description ==

Wordpress plugin used to overlay images on the current page into neat Javascript-powered overlay popups.
This plugin includes the new Slimbox 1.64 javascript written by Christophe Beils and got transformed into a Wordpress Plugin by me.
Slimbox is a 7kb visual clone of the popular Lightbox JS v2.4 by Lokesh Dhakar, written using the ultra compact mootools framework.
It was designed to be small, efficient, more convenient and 100% compatible with the original Lightbox v2.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `slimbox-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add a rel="lightbox" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox or rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" for image set
4. If you want to add automatically the lightbox effect to your post's images, open slimbox.php and remove the comment '//' from lines 19 to 22.
